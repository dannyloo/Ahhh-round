This file contains the source code for Ahhh-round, the second game launched by QEUE Games. The game has since been renamed to Mad Moji. The game should be able to build and run locally, but does not have the keystore.jks file needed to sign the .apk for release on the Play Store as to prevent other people from copying the game.
